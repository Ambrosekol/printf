##_printf README
_printf is a custom implementation of the C standard library function printf(). It allows the user to print formatted output to the standard output stream (stdout).

##Usage
The _printf() function can be called in the same way as the standard printf() function. It takes a format string as its first argument, which specifies how the remaining arguments should be formatted and printed.

int _printf(const char *format, ...);

The format string can include conversion specifiers, which begin with the % character and are followed by a conversion character that specifies the type of the argument being printed. The supported conversion specifiers are:

%c: print a character
%s: print a string
%%: print a literal percent sign
Other format specifiers, such as field width and precision, are not currently supported by _printf().

##Return Value
The _printf() function returns the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte used to terminate output to strings.

##Examples
Here are some examples of using _printf():

#include "main.h"

int main(void)
{
    int len;

    len = _printf("Hello, %s!\n", "world");
    _printf("The length of the string is %d.\n", len);

    return (0);
}
This would output:

Hello, world!
The length of the string is 14.

##Installation
To use _printf() in your own project, simply copy the main.h and main.c files into your project directory, and include main.h in your source files:

#include "main.h"
Then, compile your project with main.c as one of the source files:

$ gcc main.c your_file.c -o your_program

##Known Issues
Currently, _printf() does not handle field width, precision, or length modifiers. It also does not handle all conversion specifiers that the standard printf() function does.
